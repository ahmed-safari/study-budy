## üìã Feature Details

### Study Session Management

Study sessions are the top-level organizational units. Each session can contain multiple study materials and has properties like title, description, and subject. This helps users organize materials by topic or course.

### Material Processing

Study Buddy supports several document formats:

- **PDFs**: Uses GPT-4o to extract text and generate descriptions
- **Audio files**: Uses Whisper API to transcribe content and GPT-3.5 to generate descriptions
- **Web content**: Processes text content from web URLs

> **Note on YouTube Content**: Due to YouTube's strict API policies, direct downloading of content is not permitted.

### AI-Generated Summaries

Study Buddy creates concise, structured summaries of your study materials. The summary generation:

1. Analyzes the full content of the material
2. Identifies key topics and concepts
3. Organizes information in a hierarchical structure
4. Formats the content with markdown for readability
5. Includes explanations of complex ideas

Summaries can be viewed online, shared, printed, or downloaded as markdown files.

### Flashcard Generation

The flashcard feature uses AI to identify key terms, concepts, and information suitable for flash card format. Each flashcard consists of:

- A front side with a question or prompt
- A back side with the answer or explanation

Users can:

- Create multiple flashcard decks per material
- Customize flashcard content
- Review flashcards in study mode

### Quiz Generation

Study Buddy creates quizzes based on the material content with:

- Multiple choice questions
- True/false questions
- Fill-in-the-blank questions
- Difficulty settings (easy, medium, hard)
- Explanations for answers

### Material Viewer

The material viewer provides a clean interface for accessing processed materials:

- Formatted display of extracted text
- File information (type, size, date created)
- Access to all generated study tools (summaries, flashcards, quizzes)
- Material status monitoring

## üß† AI Implementation Details

### PDF Processing

PDFs are processed using OpenAI's GPT-4o model with the following approach:

1. The PDF file is converted to base64 encoding
2. The file is sent to the OpenAI API with a specialized system prompt
3. GPT-4o extracts all text content including headers, paragraphs, bullet points
4. The model identifies and describes visual elements (images, tables, graphs)
5. A concise description is generated for the document
6. The response is returned in JSON format with extracted text and description

### Audio Processing

Audio files are processed using OpenAI's Whisper API and GPT-3.5:

1. The audio file is converted to a suitable format
2. The file is sent to the Whisper API for transcription
3. The transcription is processed by GPT-3.5 to generate a description
4. The response includes both the transcribed text and a description

### Summary Generation

Summaries are generated using GPT-4 with a specific prompt structure:

1. The material's raw content is provided as context
2. The model is instructed to create a comprehensive summary with clear structure
3. The summary is formatted with markdown headings, bullet points, and emphasis
4. Key concepts are highlighted and complex ideas are explained
5. A brief overview is provided at the beginning

### Flashcard Generation

Flashcards are created using GPT-4 with specialized instructions:

1. The material's content is analyzed for suitable flashcard topics
2. The model identifies key terms, definitions, concepts, and facts
3. Each item is formatted as a question-answer pair
4. The front contains a question or prompt that tests understanding
5. The back contains the answer or explanation

### Quiz Generation

Quizzes are generated using GPT-4 with difficulty-specific prompting:

1. The material's content is analyzed for quiz-worthy topics
2. Questions are created based on the selected difficulty level
3. Multiple-choice options include the correct answer and plausible distractors
4. Explanations are provided for each correct answer
5. The questions are organized into a structured quiz format
